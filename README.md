<h1>Predictive Analytics for Customer Reorders in Instacart: A Machine Learning Approach</h1>
<p>This machine learning project's objective was to predict the likelihood of customers reordering products in their subsequent orders based on their historical purchase data. The dataset provided by Instacart includes over 3 million orders from more than 200,000 users, encompassing order history, product details, and purchasing patterns. The challenge was not only to accurately predict reorders but also to uncover insights into customer purchasing patterns.</p>
